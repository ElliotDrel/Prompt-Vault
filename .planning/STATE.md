# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-09)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Save OLD state on edit, not new state (current prompt always "live")
- Immutable snapshots, not deltas (easier to query/display)
- Skip versions for metadata changes (focus on content only)
- Word-level diff using `diff` npm package (readable for prose)
- Auto-save before revert (nothing ever lost)
- Phase 8 deferred (ship core feature first, optimize later)

### Deferred Issues
