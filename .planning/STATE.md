## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-13)

**Current focus:** v2.0 Public Prompt Library

## Current Position

Phase: 15 of 20 (Public Library Page)

## Shipped Milestones

### v1.0 Version History (2026-01-13)

**Delivered:** Complete version tracking system with automatic snapshots, inline diff highlighting, and one-click revert for all prompt edits.

**Stats:**
- 10 phases, 22 plans
- 96 files, 13,176 LOC TypeScript
- 128 commits over 4 days
- 122 versions in database (71 historical + 51 current)

See: `.planning/MILESTONES.md` for full details.

## Accumulated Context

### Key Learnings from v1.0

1. **RPC parameter names must match frontend exactly** - PostgREST resolves by parameter names, not positions
2. **Versioning model matters** - Define "Version N = content AFTER Nth save" upfront to avoid confusion
3. **UAT reveals conceptual errors** - Unit tests catch bugs, UAT catches wrong mental models
4. **Dual analysis for validation** - Running two independent analyses caught errors
5. **Never edit applied migrations** - Always create new migrations to fix issues

### Decisions Log

All v1.0 decisions documented in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**Phase 12 decisions:**
- Controlled component pattern for filter state in PromptListView
- Render prop (renderPromptCard) for card customization flexibility
- Derive defaults from source prop (owned shows pin, others hide)
- Link2 icon for saved prompts to indicate live-linked status

**Phase 13 decisions:**
- Initialize URL state in useState initializers (not useEffect) to avoid flash
- Only show non-default values in URL for cleaner URLs
- Controlled mode support in usePromptFilters for external state management

**Phase 14 decisions:**
- Visibility indicator on card (passive) vs toggle button in PromptView (interactive)
- Optimistic updates with server sync and rollback on error
- New prompts default to 'private' (matching Phase 11 schema)

**Phase 15 decisions:**
- RLS handles visibility filtering - no explicit auth.uid() check needed in query
- Author info initialized with userId only, displayName undefined for future profile lookup

### Deferred Issues

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

### Roadmap Evolution
