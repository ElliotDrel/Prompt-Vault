# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-09)

**Core value:** Never lose work. Every prompt edit is automatically preserved with complete history, clear diffs showing exactly what changed, and confident one-click revert to any previous state.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 — Storage Adapter Integration

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 8 (Storage Adapter Integration)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-01-11 — Completed 03-02-PLAN.md

Progress: ████░░░░░░ 26.9%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.38 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 (Database Schema & RLS) | 1 | 6 min | 6 min |
| 2 (Database Functions & Type Definitions) | 4 | 8 min | 2 min |
| 3 (Storage Adapter Integration) | 2 | 9 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 2, 2, 2, 4, 4 min
- Trend: Stable at 2-4 min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Save OLD state on edit, not new state (current prompt always "live")
- Immutable snapshots, not deltas (easier to query/display)
- Skip versions for metadata changes (focus on content only)
- Word-level diff using `diff` npm package (readable for prose)
- Auto-save before revert (nothing ever lost)
- Phase 8 deferred (ship core feature first, optimize later)
- Separate migrations for schema vs realtime (cleaner history) [Phase 1]
- Application-controlled version numbers (not auto-increment) [Phase 1]
- No UPDATE RLS policy for versions (immutable snapshots) [Phase 1]
- CASCADE delete strategy (history dies with prompt) [Phase 1]
- DECLARE block for ownership validation (clearer than subquery) [Phase 2]
- Empty result for unauthorized access (consistent with existing patterns) [Phase 2]
- Realtime event routing: Version changes trigger 'prompts' refresh (avoid breaking context callbacks) [Phase 3]
- Snake_case RPC parameters to match database function signatures [Phase 3]
- Content vs metadata detection: title, body, variables are content; isPinned, timesUsed are metadata [Phase 3]
- Graceful version error handling: failures log but don't block CRUD operations [Phase 3]
- OLD state capture on update: history preserves what existed before each change [Phase 3]
