## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Realtime Copy History Updates - Dashboard
expected: Open Dashboard prompt detail with Usage History expanded. Copy same prompt in another tab. First tab shows new copy event within 2 seconds without manual refresh.
result: pass

### 2. Realtime Copy History Updates - History Page
expected: Open /history page. Copy any prompt from Dashboard. History page shows new copy event within 2 seconds without manual refresh.
result: pass

### 3. Owner Auto-Redirect from Library
expected: As the prompt owner, click your own public prompt in the Library page. You should be automatically redirected to the Dashboard view (not stay on Library), with browser history NOT containing the Library URL.
result: pass

### 4. Non-Owner Library View (No Redirect)
expected: As a non-owner, view someone else's public prompt in Library. You should stay on the Library public view page (no redirect).
result: pass

### 5. Owned Prompt Visual Distinction in Library
expected: Your own public prompts in the Library should look identical to Dashboard cards. Other users' prompts should have a green ring/tint for visual distinction.
result: pass
note: Fixed ring conflict — pin styling and ownership styling were both applying simultaneously. Changed to if/else chain where green ring (non-owned) takes priority over yellow pin ring.

### 6. Copy History Context Note
expected: On a public prompt detail page (not your own), expand Usage History. You should see a context note like "This shows your personal usage of this prompt" indicating the history is personal, not community-wide.
result: pass

### 7. Public Prompt Badge on History Page
expected: On /history page, copy events from public prompts you don't own should show a "Public" badge with a Globe icon.
result: pass

### 8. Library Sort by Created Works
expected: On /library page, change sort to "Created" (date created). Prompts should sort correctly (newest first by default, oldest first if direction flipped). No NaN or sorting errors.
result: pass

### 9. No False Public Badges During Load
expected: Rapidly navigate to /history page. During the loading phase (before owned prompts are loaded), you should NOT see public badges flashing on prompts you own.
result: pass

### 10. Search with Spaces and Underscores
expected: If you have prompts with underscores or spaces in names (e.g., "my_prompt" or "my prompt"), search should match both variations. Searching "my_prompt" should find "my prompt" and vice versa.
result: pass
