## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Realtime Copy History Updates - Dashboard
expected: Open Dashboard prompt detail with Usage History expanded. Copy same prompt in another tab. First tab shows new copy event within 2 seconds without manual refresh.
result: pass

### 2. Realtime Copy History Updates - History Page
expected: Open /history page. Copy any prompt from Dashboard. History page shows new copy event within 2 seconds without manual refresh.
result: pass

### 3. View Public Version Button Location
expected: On Dashboard prompt detail for a public prompt, "View Public Version" button appears in top-right area near the visibility toggle (not in the action buttons area with Edit/History).
result: issue
reported: "this button shouldn't exist since it is not possible to go to that page anymore"
severity: major

### 4. Owner Auto-Redirect from Library
expected: As the prompt owner, click your own public prompt in the Library page. You should be automatically redirected to the Dashboard view (not stay on Library), with browser history NOT containing the Library URL.
result: pass

### 5. Non-Owner Library View (No Redirect)
expected: As a non-owner, view someone else's public prompt in Library. You should stay on the Library public view page (no redirect).
result: pass

### 6. Owned Prompt Visual Distinction in Library
expected: Your own public prompts in the Library should have a primary-colored border, distinguishing them from other users' prompts.
result: pass
note: User feedback - wants regular dashboard color for own prompts, green outline for others' public prompts

### 7. Copy History Context Note
expected: On a public prompt detail page (not your own), expand Usage History. You should see a context note like "This shows your personal usage of this prompt" indicating the history is personal, not community-wide.
result: pass

### 8. Public Prompt Badge on History Page
expected: On /history page, copy events from public prompts you don't own should show a "Public" badge with a Globe icon.
result: pass
note: User feedback - the View popup/modal should also show "Public" indicator

### 9. Preview as Public Button Visibility
expected: On Dashboard, view a PUBLIC prompt you own. "Preview as Public" button should appear in the top-right area (near visibility toggle). For a PRIVATE prompt, this button should NOT appear.
result: pass
note: User decision - REMOVE entire Preview as Public feature (too much complexity)

### 10. Preview as Public Modal Content
expected: Click "Preview as Public" on a public prompt. Modal opens showing: info banner "This is how others see your public prompt", variable inputs (if any), copy button, prompt body, stats. NO edit/delete/pin/visibility/history controls.
result: skipped
reason: User decision to remove entire Preview as Public feature

### 11. Preview Modal Copy Tracks Stats
expected: In the Preview as Public modal, copy the prompt. Usage stats (times used) should increment, reflecting actual usage.
result: skipped
reason: User decision to remove entire Preview as Public feature
