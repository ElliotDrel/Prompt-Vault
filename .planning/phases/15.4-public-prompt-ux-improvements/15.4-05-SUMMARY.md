# Phase 15.4 Plan 05: UAT Gap Closure Summary

**One-liner:** Removed obsolete View Public Version button and Preview as Public feature based on UAT findings

## What Was Done

### Task 1: Remove View Public Version Button

Removed the "View Public Version" button from PromptView component. This button became obsolete after implementing owner auto-redirect in Phase 15.4-03 - clicking it would navigate to the Library view which immediately redirects owners back to Dashboard.

**Changes:**
- Removed `showViewPublicButton` and `onViewPublicVersion` props from PromptView
- Removed `handleViewPublicVersion` handler from PromptDetail
- Removed Globe icon import (no longer needed)
- Removed button JSX from header row

### Task 2: Remove Preview as Public Feature

Deleted the entire Preview as Public feature per user decision that it adds too much complexity.

**Changes:**
- Deleted `src/components/PublicPreviewModal.tsx` (161 LOC)
- Removed `showPreviewButton` and `onPreview` props from PromptView
- Removed `previewOpen` state from PromptDetail
- Removed Eye icon import from PromptView

## Commits

| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| 0144094 | fix(15.4): remove View Public Version button (obsolete with auto-redirect) |
| 3d14595 | fix(15.4): remove Preview as Public feature (user decision) |

## Verification

- [x] `npm run lint` passes (0 errors, 16 pre-existing Fast Refresh warnings)
- [x] `npm run build` passes
- [x] No references to removed components/props remain in codebase
- [x] No dead code (unused imports, handlers, state)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## UI State After Cleanup

Dashboard prompt detail now shows:
- Only visibility toggle in top-right header area
- No View Public Version button
- No Preview as Public button

This creates a cleaner, less cluttered interface focused on the essential visibility control.
