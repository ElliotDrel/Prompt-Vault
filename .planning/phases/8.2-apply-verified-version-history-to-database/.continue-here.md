<current_state>
Phase 8.2 plan COMPLETE. Currently doing user acceptance testing of the 26 prompts with historical versions.

User is manually verifying each prompt's version history in the UI. 23 of 26 prompts checked and passing. 3 remain unchecked.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Task 1: Create SQL migration - Done (ef665e6)
  - Inserted 71 discovered historical versions
  - Renumbered existing backfill to highest version for each prompt

- Task 2: Verify integrity and update state - Done (c402ad6)
  - Verified 124 total versions, 26 prompts with history
  - Updated STATE.md and ROADMAP.md to milestone complete

- Fix: Timestamp correction - Done (7b7ae78)
  - Backfill used wrong timestamp (created_at instead of updated_at)
  - Created migration to fix timestamps for highest versions

- UAT: 23/26 prompts verified by user (see checklist)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
3 prompts still need user verification:
- [ ] #3: MGMT 306 HW Problem Teaching / Walkthrough - school
- [ ] #6: Clear, Install, Build, Everything Else, and Dev
- [ ] #16: Implement Features Step by Step for CC based on plan

Checklist file: `.planning/phases/8.2-apply-verified-version-history-to-database/VERSION-HISTORY-CHECKLIST.md`
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- 1-based version numbering (constraint requires version > 0)
- Discovered versions: 1..N, existing backfill: N+1
- Fixed timestamp issue: backfill now uses updated_at not created_at
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - just waiting for user to finish checking remaining 3 prompts

The Version History feature is complete! This was the final phase (8.2) of the milestone.

User is doing manual verification of all 26 prompts that got historical versions inserted. They've checked 23 so far and all look good. Just 3 more to verify, then milestone is truly done.

After UAT passes, run /gsd:complete-milestone to archive this milestone.

<next_action>
1. User finishes checking remaining 3 prompts in VERSION-HISTORY-CHECKLIST.md
2. If any issues found, diagnose and fix
3. If all pass, run /gsd:complete-milestone
