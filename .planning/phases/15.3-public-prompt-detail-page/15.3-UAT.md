## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Click prompt card in Library opens detail page
expected: In the Public Library (/library), click on any public prompt card. The app navigates to /library/prompt/{promptId} and shows the full prompt detail view.
result: pass

### 2. Public prompt detail shows prompt content (read-only)
expected: On the public prompt detail page (/library/prompt/:id), you see the prompt title, body with variable highlighting, author info, and usage stats. You can fill in variables and copy the prompt.
result: pass

### 3. Non-owner cannot see Edit/Delete buttons
expected: When viewing someone else's public prompt, there are NO Edit or Delete buttons visible. You should only see Copy functionality.
result: pass

### 4. Non-owner cannot see Version History
expected: When viewing someone else's public prompt, there is NO "Version History" button visible.
result: issue
reported: "pass BUT there is no info about that. It just looks like there is no version history yet. We need to add some info that they don't have any version history with this prompt yet BUT it's just theirs and so on"
severity: minor

### 5. Invalid/private prompt ID shows 404 page
expected: Navigate directly to /library/prompt/invalid-or-private-id. You see a "Prompt Not Found" message with a "Back to Library" link. (Same message whether prompt doesn't exist or is private.)
result: pass

### 6. Owner viewing own public prompt sees banner
expected: When logged in as the owner of a public prompt, viewing it via Library shows a banner: "You're viewing this as others see it" with a "View in Dashboard" button.
result: pass

### 7. Owner's "View in Dashboard" button works
expected: From the Library view of your own public prompt, click "View in Dashboard". You navigate to /dashboard/prompt/{promptId} where you have full edit/delete controls.
result: pass

### 8. Dashboard shows "View Public Version" for public prompts
expected: From your Dashboard, open one of your public prompts. You see a "View Public Version" button (or similar). Click it to navigate to /library/prompt/{promptId}.
result: pass

### 9. Back button navigates to Library
expected: On any public prompt detail page (/library/prompt/:id), clicking the back button (or "Back to Library") returns you to /library.
result: pass

### 10. Variable input and copy works on public prompts
expected: On a public prompt with variables (e.g., {{name}}), you can fill in the variable values in the input fields. Clicking Copy copies the filled prompt to clipboard.
result: pass

## Gaps

- truth: "Non-owners should not see or modify pin state on public prompts"
  status: failed
  reason: "User reported: On the public page, I can see whether or not the user who contributed the prompt has it pinned and then also modify that and unpin it on their behalf. Remove pinning completely from public prompt detail."
  severity: major
  test: discovered
  root_cause: "PromptView.tsx renders Pin button unconditionally in footer (lines 454-465). No prop exists to hide it."
  artifacts:
    - path: "src/components/PromptView.tsx"
      issue: "Pin button always rendered, no showPinButton prop"
  missing:
    - "Add showPinButton?: boolean prop to PromptView (default true)"
    - "Conditionally render pin button"
    - "Pass showPinButton={false} from PublicPromptDetail"
  debug_session: ""

- truth: "Non-owners should see messaging that version history is only available for their own prompts"
  status: failed
  reason: "User reported: No info shown - it just looks like there is no version history yet. Need to add info explaining version history is only available for your own prompts."
  severity: minor
  test: 4
  root_cause: "When showVersionHistory={false}, History button hidden with no alternative UI (line 302-307). No explanation provided."
  artifacts:
    - path: "src/components/PromptView.tsx"
      issue: "History button hidden silently, no messaging for non-owners"
  missing:
    - "Add subtle text note when viewing others' public prompts explaining version history is for your own prompts"
  debug_session: ""
