# Phase 15.2: Rework Filter UI - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Rework the visual design and layout of the filtering UI for improved aesthetics and usability. The functional filter system exists (from Phase 15.1) — this phase improves how it looks and feels.

## Implementation Decisions

### Visual style direction
- Segmented control pattern — inline filter|sort|direction bar
- Condensed UI — filter controls integrated into a single compact bar
- Two-column dropdown menu for quick selection
- Direction toggle accessible directly on the bar (not buried in dropdown)
- Pure CSS positioning for dropdowns (no JS-based positioning)

### Layout & positioning
- Filter/sort control positioned next to search bar
- Dropdown anchored with `position: absolute` + `top-full` for zero-jitter scrolling
- Search input with flexible width (min 200px, max 3xl)

### Active state feedback
- Check marks on selected filter/sort options
- Primary color highlight on active selections (`bg-primary/10 text-primary`)
- Directional icon changes based on sort direction (ArrowUpAZ / ArrowDownAZ)

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact spacing and padding values
- Animation timings for dropdown open/close
- Color intensity for hover states

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Replace Radix Popover with pure CSS dropdown to eliminate scroll jitter
- Segmented control should feel like a single cohesive unit
- Direction toggle should be quickly accessible without opening dropdown

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
