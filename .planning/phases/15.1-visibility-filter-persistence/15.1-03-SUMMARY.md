# 15.1-03 Summary: Filter UI Components and Page Integration

## What Was Built

### FilterSortControl Component
- Segmented control UI next to search bar
- Contains filter options and sort settings in one place
- Shows "Active" badge when filters are applied
- Reset button to clear all filters
- ToggleGroup for filter selection with icons

### Dashboard Integration
- Visibility filter: All / Public / Private (for user's own prompts)
- Sort options: Last Updated, Name, Usage Count, Date Created
- Sort direction toggle with contextual labels
- Filter preferences persist to database
- URL params sync for shareable views

### Library Integration
- Author filter only: All / Mine / Others (visibility filter removed - all prompts are public)
- Same sort options as Dashboard
- Removed onAuthorClick - author names are display-only text
- Filter preferences persist to database

### UI/UX Improvements (based on user feedback)
- Replaced row of filter chips with single popover dropdown
- Condensed UI - filters next to search bar instead of separate row
- Cleaner terminology and iconography
- Library simplified - no unnecessary visibility filter
