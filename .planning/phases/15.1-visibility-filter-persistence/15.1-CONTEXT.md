# Phase 15.1: Visibility Filter Persistence - Context

## Vision

A unified filter and sort system using filter chips that integrates with the existing filter area. Users can filter and sort prompts on both Dashboard and Library pages, with preferences persisted to the database.

## How It Works

### Filter Chips UI
- Filter chips integrate with the existing filter/search area (not separate tabs or dropdowns)
- Chips feel like one cohesive filtering system
- Applied to both Dashboard and Library pages

### Filters
1. **Visibility Filter**
   - Options: All | Public | Private
   - Default: All (show everything)

2. **Author Filter**
   - Options: All | Mine | Others
   - Useful on Library page to distinguish your public prompts from community prompts
   - On Dashboard, this may be less relevant (all prompts are yours)

### Sorts
1. **Recently Updated** (keep existing behavior)
2. **Date Created** (newest/oldest first)
3. **Most Used** (by times copied)

### Persistence
- Store filter/sort preferences in `user_settings` table
- Preferences apply across sessions and devices
- New users default to "All" visibility

## What's Essential

- Filter chips that visually integrate with existing UI
- Visibility filter (public/private/all) working on both pages
- Author filter (mine/others/all) for Library page
- Three sort options functional
- Preferences persisted to database
- Default "All" for new users

## What's Out of Scope

- Tags/categories system (future phase)
- Date range filtering (sorting by date is included, but no "last 7 days" type filter)
- Advanced text search improvements (existing search stays as-is)
- Per-page separate preferences (single preference set applies everywhere)

## Technical Notes

- Library page shows all public prompts (yours and others')
- Dashboard shows only your prompts
- Filter behavior may differ slightly between pages based on context
- `user_settings` table already exists for `time_saved_multiplier` - extend for filter preferences

## Open Questions for Planning

- Should "Author: Mine" on Dashboard be hidden since all Dashboard prompts are yours?
- What's the exact chip styling to match existing UI?
- How to handle URL query params for shareable filtered views (if at all)?
- Issue 10: Public Library author click currently injects text into search and overwrites any existing search term.
- Decide whether author filtering should support a specific authorId (click-to-filter) or remain Mine/Others only.
- If using author filter chips, ensure author click updates author filter state without clobbering the search term.
