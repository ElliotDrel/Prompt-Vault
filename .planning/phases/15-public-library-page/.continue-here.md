<current_state>
Executing 15-FIX.md (UAT fixes for Phase 15).

All 4 implementation tasks are COMPLETE and COMMITTED.
Currently at Task 5: human-verify checkpoint - awaiting user approval.

User was asked to verify the fixes work correctly. They then requested an additional change (add Prompt Vault logo to nav), which was implemented and committed.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Task 1: Create shared AppLayout with persistent nav/stats - DONE (3dc64ea)
- Task 2: Extend search to include title, body, and author name - DONE (1cf412e)
- Task 3: Visibility toggle redesign with toggle switch and icons - DONE (b5e5158, caf9d55)
- Task 4: Invalidate public prompts query on visibility toggle - DONE (62c09a5)
- Additional: Add Prompt Vault logo + name to navigation (7a6943c, 95357fc)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- Task 5: Human-verify checkpoint - WAITING for user approval
- After approval: Create 15-FIX-SUMMARY.md
- After approval: Update STATE.md
- After approval: Commit metadata with `docs(15-FIX): complete UAT fixes plan`
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Use actual favicon (/icon0.svg) for nav logo instead of generic Lucide icon
- Changed Dashboard header from "Prompt Vault" to "My Prompts" to avoid repetition
- Visibility icons only show on Dashboard cards (source='owned'), not Library cards
- Removed duplicate VisibilityToggle from PromptView footer (keep only top right)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - just waiting for user verification.

- .planning/phases/15-public-library-page/15-FIX.md (the plan file)
- .planning/phases/15-public-library-page/15-UAT-ISSUES.md (the issues file)
These will be committed with the SUMMARY as metadata.

<context>
The 15-FIX plan addresses 5 UAT issues discovered during /gsd:verify-work:
- UAT-001: Library doesn't refresh after visibility toggle (FIXED - query invalidation)
- UAT-002: Library page missing persistent layout (FIXED - AppLayout)
- UAT-003: Navigation bar layout needs reorganization (FIXED - centered nav with logo)
- UAT-004: Search should include author name (FIXED - extended usePromptFilters)
- UAT-005: Visibility toggle needs redesign (FIXED - Switch component with tooltips)

All code changes are committed. User started verification, then requested logo be added to nav - that's done too.
</context>

<next_action>
1. Ask user to verify fixes work correctly (they may have already done this)
2. If approved: Create 15-FIX-SUMMARY.md
3. Update STATE.md with completion info
4. Commit metadata: `docs(15-FIX): complete UAT fixes plan`
5. Offer next steps (likely Phase 16: Add to Vault)
</next_action>
