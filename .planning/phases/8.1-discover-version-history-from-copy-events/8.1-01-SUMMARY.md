# Phase 8.1 Plan 01: Discover Version History Summary

**Discovered 71 historical versions across 26 prompts from 707 copy events, with v1 vs v2 analysis merge validation.**

## Accomplishments

- Analyzed 707 copy events across 40 prompts with copy history
- Ran two independent analyses (v1 and v2) for validation
- v2 analysis found 68 versions across 24 prompts (more granular)
- v1 analysis captured 2 additional prompts missed by v2
- Merged final result: 71 historical versions across 26 prompts
- Identified 13 prompts where current state differs from last copy event
- Generated verified DISCOVERED-VERSIONS-FINAL.md for Phase 8.2

## Analysis Approach

1. **v1 Analysis:** Initial sub-agent analysis of all prompts
2. **v2 Analysis:** Fresh parallel analysis (29 sub-agents) for validation
3. **Discrepancy Review:** Investigated body text differences and missing prompts
4. **Merge:** Used v2 as base (more accurate body text) + 2 prompts from v1

## Files Created

- `.planning/phases/8.1-discover-version-history-from-copy-events/DISCOVERED-VERSIONS.md` - v1 analysis
- `.planning/phases/8.1-discover-version-history-from-copy-events/DISCOVERED-VERSIONS-v2.md` - v2 analysis
- `.planning/phases/8.1-discover-version-history-from-copy-events/DISCOVERED-VERSIONS-FINAL.md` - Merged final report

## Key Findings

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total prompts analyzed | 40 |
| Prompts with discovered versions | 26 |
| Prompts with NO version changes | 14 |
| Total historical versions | 71 |
| Most evolved prompt | "Identify Status and Next Steps" (8 versions) |
| Prompts where current differs from last copy | 13 |

## Decisions Made

1. **Version numbering:** Start at 0 for discovered versions (existing backfill v1 becomes highest number)
2. **v2 as base:** v2 captured more accurate body text and detected more granular changes
3. **v1 supplement:** Added 2 prompts v2 missed (buildpurdue long form, Generate Interview Clip Social Posts)
4. **Body text discrepancies:** All 3 "discrepancies" were v2 being more accurate than v1

## Prompts Added from v1 (missed by v2)

1. **buildpurdue long form content** (`590d513e...`) - 2 versions discovered
2. **Generate Interview Clip Social Posts** (`a31fca67...`) - 1 version discovered (title was "buildpurdue short-form descriptions")

## Issues/Notes

- 9 prompts have current state different from last copy - this is expected as users continued editing after last copy
- No reconstruction errors encountered
- Variable reconstruction worked correctly for all prompts

## Next Step

Ready for Phase 8.2: Apply Verified Version History to Database

**IMPORTANT for Phase 8.2:**
- Use DISCOVERED-VERSIONS-FINAL.md as source
- Version numbers start at 0 for discovered, existing backfill becomes highest
- Carefully validate INSERT statements before execution
- Consider running on test data first
