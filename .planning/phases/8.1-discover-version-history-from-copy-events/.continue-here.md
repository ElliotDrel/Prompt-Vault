<current_state>
Completed fresh v2 analysis of all 38 prompts with copy events. Created DISCOVERED-VERSIONS-v2.md with ~58 discovered versions across 24 prompts.

User requested detailed comparison of v1 vs v2 discrepancies before deciding merge strategy. Presented discrepancy report and asked via AskUserQuestion how to merge. User selected "Review specific discrepancies first" but then paused work before we could drill into details.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Task 1: Fresh analysis of all 38 prompts - DONE
  - Launched 29 parallel sub-agents to analyze each prompt's copy events
  - Created DISCOVERED-VERSIONS-v2.md with complete findings
  - Found ~58 versions across 24 prompts (vs v1's ~45 across 21 prompts)

- Discrepancy report completed comparing v1 vs v2:
  - Category 1: Body text discrepancies (3 prompts)
  - Category 2: Version count discrepancies (11 prompts)
  - Category 3: Prompts in one analysis but not other (3 prompts)
  - Category 4: Current differs flags (9 prompts)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- Review the 3 specific body text discrepancies in detail:
  1. Prompt 1 (Clear, Install, Build) - v1 has shorter body, v2 has full command
  2. Prompt 5 (Make Changes After Code Review) - different v0 body text
  3. Prompt 6 (Code Review for Uncommitted) - different v0 body text

- Review the 2 prompts found in v1 but not v2:
  - buildpurdue long form content (590d513e-3514-4d37-90a3-816c5a9d77ed)
  - Generate Interview Clip Social Posts (a31fca67-8d6a-415c-a562-a4e9e0faf39f)

- After review: Decide merge strategy with user
- Create final merged DISCOVERED-VERSIONS.md (or keep v2)
- Get user approval at checkpoint
- Create SUMMARY.md and commit plan completion
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Used sub-agents (29 parallel) to analyze prompts efficiently
- Version numbering in v2 starts at 0 (vs v1 starting at 1)
- v2 found more granular intermediate versions in many prompts
- v2 explicitly tracks "current differs from last copy" cases
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - just need user decision on how to handle discrepancies
</blockers>

<context>
The purpose of running v2 was as a "check" against v1 to find things the previous analysis may have missed or discrepancies. We found:

1. v2 generally found MORE versions (58 vs 45) because it detected more granular changes
2. v2 has more accurate body text for some prompts (full commands vs truncated)
3. v1 found 2 prompts that v2 didn't process (different prompt_ids or edge cases)

User wants to review the specific discrepancies before deciding merge strategy. The AskUserQuestion response was "Review specific discrepancies first".

Key files:
- v1: .planning/phases/8.1-discover-version-history-from-copy-events/DISCOVERED-VERSIONS.md
- v2: .planning/phases/8.1-discover-version-history-from-copy-events/DISCOVERED-VERSIONS-v2.md
</context>

<next_action>
Resume by:
1. Query the 3 prompts with body text discrepancies to determine which version is correct
2. Check why the 2 v1-only prompts weren't in v2 (query their copy events)
3. Present findings to user
4. Get merge strategy decision
5. Create final merged document or confirm v2 as source
6. Complete checkpoint approval and create SUMMARY.md
</next_action>

Discrepancy summary for quick reference:

**Body Text Discrepancies (verify which is correct):**
- Prompt 1 (2f1b06b6): v2 has full command with lint/audit/typecheck
- Prompt 5 (2b9ec168): Different earliest version body
- Prompt 6 (e3af62de): Different earliest version body

**Version Count Differences (v2 found more):**
- Prompt 7: v1=6, v2=8 (most evolved prompt)
- Prompt 3: v1=5, v2=6
- Prompt 18: v1=3, v2=5
- Prompt 19: v1=1, v2=3

**Missing from v2 (need to investigate):**
- 590d513e-3514-4d37-90a3-816c5a9d77ed (buildpurdue long form)
- a31fca67-8d6a-415c-a562-a4e9e0faf39f (Interview Clip Social Posts)
